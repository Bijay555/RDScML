My sub Directory contains **two types of Files**,

1. The **jupyter notebook** relevant to an issue. 
2. A **modules.py** file that contains classes/functions that can be used with multiple data sets and projects. This file is common for all
jupyter notebooks and hence promotes resuability of code. This will be updated with each issue requirements.
